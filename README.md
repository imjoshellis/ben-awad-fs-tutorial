# Ben Awad Full Stack Tutorial
Followed a tutorial to learn some new tech. 

FYI, my commit history on this is sloppy since Ben's repo/video exist if I ever want to look back at the evolution of the project. 

You should check out Ben's repo which has excellent commit history: https://github.com/benawad/lireddit
